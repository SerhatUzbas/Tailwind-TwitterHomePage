# Twitter homepage with Tailwind

Twitter homepage that is created with Tailwind.

This project's purpose is using and exploring Tailwind.

It is just homepage design.(not dynamic)

## Important

I did not know Tailwind only supports Mobile first for responsive when I started the project, so making it responsive could be really painful after I design it as "Desktop First". Because of that, the site is not responsive and under 1200 px, it looks ugly. Please evaluate this project for >1200 px.
